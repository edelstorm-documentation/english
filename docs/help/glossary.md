#GLOSSARY

Here is a glossary of possibly tricky words you will run into during this training.<br>
Use this during your training if necessary!

##**<a href="#">Server**
A server is a computer, but way more powerful than your computer. It is created to **give information and software to other computers**. Those computers are liked to it through a network (internet, Ethernet cables...).<br>
To create a website, you use a server, so a computer, but a **distance virtual** one. It allows you, among other things, to receive emails, stock data and access the web.

##Instance
An instance is a **virtual server** allowing running applications on the Amazon Web Services infrastructure.

##Domain name
A domain name is an **address where the users can go to visit your website**. For example, the domain name of Edelstorm is edelstorm.io.

##Domain name extension
That's what comes after your website name, for example: .com or .io or .eu ...

##Terminal
A terminal is synonymous for a computer. So a terminal is a computer? Yes, but it is also the **name we give to the "tool" that allows us to "speak" to a computer**.

By entering "commands" in your computer terminal, **you ask him to do this or that**.<br>
For example, when you type the command "cd images/Italy/", you ask your computer to go to the "Italy" folder. You also tell him that this folder is itself in the "images" folder.

##Static IP
A static IP address (Internet Protocol) is a **permanent number assigned to a computer by an Internet Service Provider**.<br>
A computer (or a server, since we saw that a server is a computer) with an assigned static IP address uses the same IP address when connecting to the Internet.<br>
An IP can also be dynamic, depending on your ISP, so your computer may have a dynamic IP address. Meaning, it changes when you disconnect your computer from the Internet.

##DNS zone (Domain Name System) 
Devices connected to an IP network, such as the Internet, have an IP address that identifies them on the network. These addresses are numeric to facilitate their processing by machines.

To enable access to hosts (us, Internet users) on an IP network, a system has been set up to associate a name with an IP address. This name, easier to remember, is called "domain name". DNS is the **IT service used to translate Internet domain names into IP addresses** for machines.

##SSL
SSL is the most common **security protocol** that creates a **secure canal between two machines** by using the Internet or an internal network.

##SSH
Thanks to "Secure Shell" (SSH) you can establish a **secured connexion between your computer and your website server**. The transfer of your data and your user's data are encrypted.

##HTTPS
HTTPS or "Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure" is the **secure version of the HTTP**. HTTP is a communication protocol that allows the connection between a client and a server for the World Wide Web (www).

##Wordpress theme and child theme
A WordPress theme is **a set of files controlling the design and functionality of a WordPress site**. The direct modification of a theme has an impact on its update to new versions. That's why we use the child theme.

A child theme in WordPress is a theme that inherits the code and features of another WordPress theme, then called the parent theme. It offers the possibility to customize an existing theme without making any direct changes. It is, therefore, **an overlay on which to work rather than modifying the parent theme itself**.

##Shell script
Enable actions like adding a software, update software or setting your instance in another way.
